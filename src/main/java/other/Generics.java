// Arrays are reified (Google defines as "make something more concrete or real") which means that
// arrays know and enforce their element types at runtime.
// Generics are generally non-reifiable (intuitively, according to Bloch, means runtime
// representation contains less information than compile time information) because of type-erasure,
// though there are obscure exceptions, see method pedanticStuff.
// So arrays and generics usually don't play well together.

// There really are 4 different types: "Normal" types (String), generic types (List<E>),
// parameterized types (List<String>, List<Integer> etc.) and raw types (List).
// Each generic type defines a set of parameterized types.

// Generic types also come in 4 different flavors, normal or wildcard and bounded or unbounded.
// Type 1
// Generic type: List<E> - No bound on the parameterized types.
// Bloch: There is a duality between type parameters and wildcards, and many method can be declared
// using one or the other.
// Type 2
// Bounded generic type: List<E extends String>
// A special subtype is recursively bounded generic type. The most common is the following (and the
// type bound may be read as "for every type E that can be compared to itself"):
// List<E extends Comparable<E>>
// Type 3
// Unbounded wildcard type: List<?> - If you want to use a generic type but you don't know or care
// what the actual type parameter is. To realize the difference between List<?> and List<E> look at
// method numCommon. Also, while List<Object> is parameterized type representing a list that can
// contain objects of any type, List<?> is a wildcard type.
// Bloch rule: If a type parameter appears only once in a method declaration, replace it with a
// wildcard.
// representing a set that can contain only objects of some unknown type.
// Type 4
// Bounded wildcard type: List<? extends String> or List<? super String> - For covariance and
// contra-variance, see classes MyStack and MyStackTest.
